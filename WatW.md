## Prompt: 
Our focus with “Worlds at Waste: Water” is to reflect on recent climate events that have caused massive displacement in [southern Pakistan](https://reliefweb.int/report/pakistan/pakistan-2022-monsoon-floods-situation-report-no-12-5-december-2022), [southwest India](https://nidm.gov.in/PDF/pubs/ChennailFlood_NIDM2021.pdf) and [Bangladesh](https://www.unicef.org/documents/bangladesh-floods-situation-report-27-june-2022). We aim to bring together scientists and social scientists to help us look through the lens of historical pasts, politics, and an embedded presents. Devastations and displacement from water caused by climate crists is and will remain a recurring, returning, and pervasive phenomenon in the global south. Our approach intends a shift from an overwhelming focus on modeling catastrophic futures, the periodization of eras, and mapping the implications of climate change that prevails in  in current dialogues on climate change towards a conversation that foregrounds human and environmental vulnerability in non-Western, transnational spaces with indigenous and historical means of resilience. We aim to continue this series with focus on Air and Land.

## Format
The workshop panels move from the Himalayas to the Sea. Each panel consists of two presenters who will each present for 20 or so minutes. Each panel will be an hour. The intent is to put into direct conversation a climate scientist with a social scientist; a climate activist and a policy expert. The participants will share their presentation or deck w/ their interlocuter in advance of the workshop and we expect the panel to reflect that engagement. We will seek to publish the presentations as short-essays.
