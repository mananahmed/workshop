## Prompt

Today we face a new and brutal phase of nationalist politics the world over.  Despite the rise of “globalization” and attendant theorization of post-national futures, the nation-state has re-emerged, most visibly and dangerously in the populist authoritarianisms from the United States and Hungary, to Turkey and India as well as the nationalist and xenophobic fervor shaping all aspects of global politics, not least in the ongoing wars in Yemen and Ukraine.  

Partha Chatterjee is one of the most original and critical thinkers of nationalism, populism and postcolonial democracy. A leading historian, anthropologist, political theorist, and public intellectual, Chatterjee's path-breaking work has shaped a generation of scholarship on the politics and history of the nation-state. A founding member of the “Subaltern Studies” collective, his scholarship critiqued much of the conventional wisdom about nationalism in the 1980s and 1900s. *Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World* (1986) was a landmark statement on the discursive contradictions and limits of anti-colonial nationalism. In the acclaimed intervention *The Nation and its Fragments: Colonial and Postcolonial Histories*, Chatterjee deftly pivoted away from state-centered ideas of nationhood to chart and conceptualize the heterogeneity internal to nationalism, from historical constructions of difference to the identities and experiences that nationalism reconfigures.  

With *The Politics of the Governed: Reflections on Popular Politics in Most of the World* (2004) and *Lineages of Political Society: Studies in Postcolonial Democracy* (2011), Chatterjee honed in on practices of popular politics that were invisible to traditional lens of political theory. He proposed a wholly novel viewpoint and conceptual vocabulary to understand new forms of popular mobilization which themselves were intimately bound with the arrival of postcolonial democracy. Over the last thirty years, *Nation and Its Fragments* and *The Politics of the Governed* have provided some of the most original and influential theoretical frameworks for the study of the postcolony in Africa, Asia, Latin American and in a fruitful comparative frame with Europe and North America.

This conference “Nations in Fragments” returns to Partha Chatterjee’s essential scholarship on nationalism and democracy to build new conceptual vocabularies for the 21st century that can meet the challenges of democratic decline, unending pandemic, capitalist crises, and climate catastrophe.
